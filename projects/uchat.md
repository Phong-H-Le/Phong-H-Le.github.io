<h3>Overview</h3>

Class project from Duke Kunshan University. UChat is an anonymous 1-on-1 chat app for university students to meet and connect based on shared hobbies — think Omegle, but for your campus. Built with React Native for cross-platform support and Firebase for real-time messaging, authentication, and push notifications.
