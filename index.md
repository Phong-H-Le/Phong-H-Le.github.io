    <p>
      I'm a dual-degree undergraduate at Duke University. 
      Pursuing a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering & B.A. in Computer Science.<br>
      My work focuses on machine learning, diagnostic imaging, bioinstrumentation, and health tech.
      I enjoy breaking down complex systems into clear and explainable blocks.<br>
      Born in Hue City, Vietnam & raised in Myrtle Beach, SC.
      In my free time, I enjoy reading classics/theology, going to the gym, and cooking.<br>
